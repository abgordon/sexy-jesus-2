# Sexy Jesus 2: The Second Coming

Art imitates life. Just as Jesus shuffled off this mortal coil, my Sexy Jesus repo ceased to be active. But Jesus came back - and so did Sexy Jesus.

Developers, how lame is the Instagram API? So many rules, right? This iteration of Sexy Jesus is foregoing the Instagram tag-based posting method and adopts a site-native method to uploading your Sexy posts. Drawbacks of Instagram include:

* Rigorous application process to obtain non-sandboxed API keys
* no guarantee that geotagging of user posts with relevant hashtags is enabled, leaving a tiny subset of active posts to be rendered in the sexy UI
* third party software dependency that has Zero obligation to your product
* pollution of your tagged "namespace" by unrelated posters

This project also flees the bloated corpse that ReactJS has become in favor of VueJS, which is (for now, at least) far more lightweight and easier to implement than React is. JSX? No. TypeScript? No. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Vue.js library and API.

The goal of this repo is:

`Implement an appropriately stylized Mapbox map with user posts rendered via a native submission form, ideally with a google-map style pin to lock in a location.`

Sexy jesus is coming - again.
